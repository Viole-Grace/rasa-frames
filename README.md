Decision making through conversation involves comparing items and exploring different alternatives. This requires memory.

Rasa Frames is a fork of Rasa that augments the `DialogueStateTracker` with multiple copies of slots (or Frames), each corresonding to an item of discussion.

This project is directly inspired by the [Microsoft Frames](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/frames-dataset/) dataset.

## Introduction

Here is a typical conversation between a travel agent bot and yet another Bangalorean who ends up going to Goa for a vacation. You can see the user and the bot going through various options before narrowing down on the final one.

Rasa Frames aims to automatically manage the gory details of creating, switching, and
referencing frames so that you can focus on writing the core "business logic" of
your bot.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/msamogh/rasa-frames
```

2. Install the package (preferably inside a virtualenv):
```
cd rasa-frames && pip install -e .
```

## Getting Started: Your First Framebot
If you aren't already familiar with Rasa, then check out the [Rasa tutorial](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/user-guide/rasa-tutorial/).

### 1. The Domain
Slots that you want to be replicated across multiple frames are called frame-slots. To indicate that you want a slot to be a frame-slot, simply add the `frame_slot: True` property under that slot in your domain file.

```yaml
slots:
  city:
    type: unfeaturized
    frame_slot: true
  budget:
    type: unfeaturized
    frame_slot: true
  ref:
    type: unfeaturized
    frame_slot: true
  name:                 # a regular slot that stays the same across all frames
    type: text
```
