Decision making through conversation involves comparing items and exploring different alternatives. This requires memory.

Rasa Frames is a fork of Rasa that augments the `DialogueStateTracker` with multiple copies of slots (or `Frame`s), each corresonding to an item of discussion.

This project is directly inspired by the [Microsoft Frames](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/frames-dataset/) dataset.
